## smartling-cli jobs

Manage translation jobs and monitor their progress.

### Synopsis

Translation jobs are the fundamental unit of work in Smartling TMS that organize
content for translation and track it through the translation workflow.

The jobs command group provides tools to interact with translation jobs, including
monitoring translation progress, viewing job details, and managing job workflows.

Each job contains one or more files targeted for translation into specific locales,
with defined due dates and workflow steps. Jobs help coordinate translation work between
content owners, project managers, and translators.

Available options:
  --output string   Output format: json, simple (default "simple")
                    - simple: Human-readable format optimized for terminal display
                    - json: Raw API response for programmatic processing and automation
